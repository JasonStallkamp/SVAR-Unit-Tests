Unit test are split from the main repositor to allow for testing without the required specialized hardware and software. Tests are written using the Nunit testing framework

## Running Tests

To run in the external console runner, run RunTests.bat. A basic output will be displayed in the console, and a more detailed output will be written out to TestResult.xml.
